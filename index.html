	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>This project is  where I explore retrocomputing to understand how computing came to be, how to make it better and to maybe find new simplicity in it. Old computers were not just simpler but also more diverse. Many good ideas are stuck in the past waiting to be found. Let us go to the old basement and find them. Time spent learning is never wasted.</p>

	<h2>2. Topics</h2>
	<p>My main interest is with computers that were intended for 'serious' use ranging from software development, engineering and office use to carrying  DOS applications around in your pocket.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Late-era minicomputers (especially DEC PDP-11 and VAX)</li>
	  <li>DOS subnotebooks (Toshiba Libretto 100CT)</li>
	  <li>Pocket retrocomputing (HP 200LX, HP Jornada 720)</li>
	  <li>IBM mainframes (S/370 MVS and VM/CMS)</li>
	  <li>Retro Windows (Win2000, WinCE)</li>
	</ul>
